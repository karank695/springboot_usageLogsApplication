This Spring Boot project is designed to fetch client-related data from a database and generate dynamic reports based on predefined business conditions. It is a RESTful application that allows users or systems to generate filtered reports (such as CSV) by calling a simple API.

Key Features:
REST API to fetch and process client data
Conditional filtering (e.g., status = ACTIVE, balance > threshold)
Dynamic report generation in CSV format
Clean separation of layers: Controller, Service, Repository
In-memory H2 database for quick setup and testing
Log generation for request tracking and debugging
